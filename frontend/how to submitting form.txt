I need to create useState to store datas for the inputs
To submit forms i need to make handleChange function to store the data from the inputs,options etc 
handleChange basically the logic for the useState to work
After that i need handleSubmit function in order to take the datas from the useState and use it for the CRUD
i need to put type="submit" IN THE BUTTON
and in the form onSubmit="handleSubmit"

this means that like handleChange gets the datas and then i create handleSubmit, 
and it will be the one that sends the data that it gets from the handleChange 
but i will use the inputs from the useState right like inputs.lastname i will use in the 
handleSubmit for post or patch

useState → stores the data from your form inputs (text fields, selects, checkboxes, etc.)

handleChange → updates the state as the user types/selects, so React always has the current form data

This is what makes your inputs “controlled”

handleSubmit → reads the state (useState) and uses it to send data to your backend (POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE)

type="submit" → the button triggers the form submission

onSubmit={handleSubmit} → the form calls your handleSubmit function when submitted
