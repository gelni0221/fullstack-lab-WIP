Notes about JWT storage

Option 1: Store JWT in localStorage or sessionStorage

No credentials: true needed.

No cookie parser needed.

But vulnerable to XSS if your frontend is compromised.

**Option 2: Store JWT in HTTP-only cookie

Use res.cookie("token", jwt, { httpOnly: true, sameSite: "lax" })

Browser automatically sends it with requests.

Safer from XSS, but now you need:

CORS with credentials: true

cookie-parser on backend

credentials: "include" in frontend fetch/axios

✅ For most secure apps, HTTP-only cookies are recommended.

If you want, I can make a complete JWT signup/login flow showing exactly:

Signup → JWT creation → store in cookie

Login → issue JWT

Frontend fetch requests with credentials: "include"

Protected routes using JWT verification
